I am an employee of UC Berkeley, which therefore makes me an
employee of the State of California.

By law, all works that I create as part of my job are
owned by the University of California Regents.  However, the
open nature of academic research work allows me leeway to
ascribe other open source licenses to the fruits of my labor.

Therefore, I am releasing this software under the Gnu General
