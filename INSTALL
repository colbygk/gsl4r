== Install

Options to install,

	
local gem file using rake:

  rake install

System wide gem install using rake

  sudo rake install


You must also update your environment so that GSL4r can find the gsl shared library, under Mac OS X, and using macports, this is something along the lines of:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Under linux, it might look something like,

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
