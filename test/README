Most tests are generated automatically by running at the top of the source tree:

rake test

This will create C programs that make calls to GSL functions, then writing the
results as Ruby programs that cross check the FFI based wrapper answers against
the C programs' results using Test::Unit.

Other tests include:

block_test.rb - Test basic operations dealing with gsl_block types
