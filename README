GSL4r
Ruby GNU Scientific Library via FFI

The Foreign Function Interface allows for run-time bindings to shared libraries. Using FFI to interface between Ruby and other libraries written in other languages makes these libraries runnable across all Ruby interpreters that have FFI capabilties (MRI, JRuby, etc...).

This avoids the complications with implementation specific C extensions or Java Native Interfaces in the case of JRuby.

== Documentation

This project is currently in its alpha stages and as of 01 Mar 2010, I have only pushed a library for using Complex functions in GSL, all constants are defined, and some functions for handling blocks and vectors containing blocks.

== Getting Started

Right now you can look at the existing project by cloning the GIT repository via:

git clone git://rubyforge.org/gsl4r.git

== Installing gsl4r

gem install -r gsl4r

== Examples

cd gsl4r/lib
irb -r gsl4r
irb(main):001:0> require 'gsl4r/complex'
=> true
irb(main):002:0> include GSL4r
=> Object
irb(main):004:0> a=GSL_Complex.create(1,1)
=> (1.0,1.0)
irb(main):005:0> b=GSL_Complex.create(2,2)
irb(main):009:0> a.abs
=> 1.4142135623731
irb(main):012:0> b.add(a)
=> (3.0,3.0)
irb(main):013:0> a.logabs
=> 0.346573590279973
irb(main):014:0> a.gsl_complex_logabs
=> 0.346573590279973
irb(main):016:0> include GSL4r::Complex::Methods
=> Object
irb(main):015:0> gsl_complex_add(a,b)
=> (3.0,3.0)
